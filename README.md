# ProteinFolding
Project 2 in TMA4320

Amund Fredriksen, Marius Sunde Sivertsen, Svein Ã…mdal.

The motivation for this biophysical project is to study the behaviour of proteins while they are folding. The folding is caused by random thermal fluctuations, or restoring forces that originates from the available potential in the molecule.  
The random nature of the protein is numerically simulated by python-scripts from this repository, and the final findings are presented in the report.
